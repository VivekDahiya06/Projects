🌤️ Weather App

The Weather App is a real-time weather forecasting application that allows users to search for and view the current weather conditions of any city. Built with React, this project showcases how to integrate third-party APIs for fetching weather data and implement modern UI/UX practices.

Key Features:

🌍 Search Functionality: Users can search for any city globally to get real-time weather information.

☀️ Live Weather Data: Displays temperature, humidity, and weather conditions fetched from a weather API.

🎛️ Interactive UI: Includes a sidebar navigation that toggles visibility when clicking a menu icon.

Technologies Used:

React: For building the dynamic user interface.
OpenWeather API: To fetch real-time weather data.
CSS3: For responsive design and styling.
JavaScript: For handling the logic and interactivity.
This project helped enhance my skills in API integration, state management in React, and responsive web design.
