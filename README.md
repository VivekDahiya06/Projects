🚀 Vervebridge Internship Projects.

Welcome to the Vervebridge repository! 🎉 This is where I showcase all the cool projects I’ve worked on during my internship at Vervebridge. Each folder represents a different project, and I’ve included everything you need to understand and run them. Dive in and explore! 😎


📁 Contents

🌤️ Weather App

A simple, responsive weather app built with React. Users can search any city to get real-time weather data, including temperature, humidity, and conditions, via the OpenWeather API. The app features a clean design with a toggleable sidebar for easy navigation.

... (More to come as I push more projects!)

Each project contains:

✅ Source code

📝 Documentation

🛠️ Technologies Used

Here are the main tools and technologies I've worked with in these projects:

React: Building dynamic user interfaces.

JavaScript (ES6+): For all the logic and interactivity.

HTML5 & CSS3: Structuring and styling the pages.

Git & GitHub: Version control and collaboration.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
